        <h2>Top 3 Anime</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>One Piece</h3>
                <img src="images/one-piece.png" alt="One Piece Poster" width="200">
                <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> One Piece is a manga and anime series that follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a young man who has a single dream: To find the legendary treasure known as the One Piece and become the King of the Pirates. </p>
                <p><strong>Why I Love It:</strong> It is a wonderful story about friendship and adventure. There is a lot of moments when I wanted to be a part of the crew and join the Strawhats in their travels across the Grandline. The world-building, character development and the non-stop foreshadowing is top-notch! Highly recommended for people who loves adventures like me.</p>
            </li>

                <h3>Haikyu</h3>
                <img src="images/haikyu.jpg" alt="Haikyu Poster" width="200">
                <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> "Haikyu!!" is a Japanese manga and anime series that follows Shoyo Hinata, a high school student with a passion for volleyball despite his short stature. Inspired by a legendary player known as "The Little Giant," Hinata joins Karasuno High School's volleyball team. There, he meets Tobio Kageyama, a talented but arrogant setter, and the two initially clash but eventually form a formidable partnership. Together with their teammates, they strive to restore Karasuno's reputation as a top team, facing numerous challenges and rival schools along the way. The series highlights themes of perseverance, teamwork, and the thrill of competitive sports.</p>
                <p><strong>Why I Love It:</strong> I believe that all of anime lovers had a sports anime phase. Haikyu was the best sports anime for me and made me love volleyball. I am not a sporty person but after watching it with my brother, I bought a volleyball haha. The characters are so well written, well aside from the fact that they are very attractive, cartoon-wise lol.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Ace of Diamond</h3>
                <img src="images/ace-of-diamond.jpg" alt="Ace of Diamond Poster" width="200">
                <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> "Ace of Diamond" is a Japanese sports anime and manga series that follows the journey of Eijun Sawamura, a passionate and talented pitcher with an unorthodox style. After being scouted, he joins the prestigious Seidou High School, where he aims to become the team's ace. At Seidou, Eijun faces fierce competition from skilled teammates like the cool and strategic catcher Kazuya Miyuki and the powerful pitcher Satoru Furuya. Through intense training, challenging matches, and personal growth, Eijun strives to overcome his limitations and lead his team to the national championships, showcasing themes of perseverance, teamwork, and the spirit of baseball.</p>
                <p><strong>Why I Love It:</strong> This anime is very special to me. I can't remember how many times I rewatched this anime. It was a roller coaster ride of emotions for the MC Eijun and there was a lot of time that I relate to him. Maybe that is why this anime is part of my top 3.</p>
